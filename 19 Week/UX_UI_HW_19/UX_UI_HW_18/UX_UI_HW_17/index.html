                <h1>Carlos Cisneros</h1>
                <p>Hi y'all, I'm a junior UX/UI designer, I graduated with a masters in anthropology which helped me in my journey as its a field that deals with communities and how we can work to be advocates as well as researchers in these spaces. Later I found a job in IT working for public education here in Georgia. After hearing about the complaints that many people have with technical issues, it led me to this career where I hope to mitigate the frustration that end users have when working with tools that have become an everday necessity.</p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>My background in ethnographic research and work with different communites has prepared me to be a well adapted researcher. Using these skills I would be an invaluable asset to any team that requires any type of user interviews</p>

                <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
                <p> Learning about color theory, and working with a variety of different resourcas has helped in molding a varied perspective on design. The art of design, the way people interact with it, and the way that we can be influenced by good design all factor into whatever it is that I am working on.</p>

                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p> Learning how to code using HTML, bootstrap, jquery, have influenced my decesion making when coming up with new designs. Realizng just how much work is necessary and required in the backend helps in deciding what is absolutely necessary in design, and also helping show what needs to be focused on more.</p>

                  <h4>Cairn</h4>
                  <p>My first project in my UX bootcamp, Cairn was an idea that I came up with and designed from the ground up. The basic premise was to create a travel app, and digging into my roots as an anthropologist, I wanted to create an app that was community based. Thinking about how cairns are created by other travellers as a way to guide others, I named my app thus to retain that spirit of community helping and advice.</p>

                  <h4>Buffer</h4>
                  <p> Buffer was my first group project. While working on this app, I took on the role of user researcher but also at times I would be a sort of team leader/organizer. Helping our team meet certain deadlines while also trying to make sure that everyone withing the project felt that their ideas were heard and expressed. Never forgetting that the end goal was to create an app for our users, not for us kept most decesions in check.</p>

                  <h4>drawchange</h4>
                  <p>My first non-profit work was heavily influenced by design. The nonprofit website, drawgchange, was alreayd a well desing website in terms of art and color, but upon further scrutiny we realized from users we interviewed that it required a lot more work in terms of volunteering and donating. By simplyfing the work needed to volunteer and donate, our hope was that more users in the future would be more inclined to do both, and therefore give more resources to the organization that will further help the community it serves.</p>
